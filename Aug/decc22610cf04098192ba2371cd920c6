I came across this from someone detailing his reasons why some ladies will never get married, and I couldn t resist the urge to share. The ladies might have lessons to pick from it.NOTE: It is NOT funny. You are allowed to laugh though, but do not forget the lessons inherent.Many African ladies will end up singles for life because of media exposure It is so disheartening how a lady will glue her eyes on a mobile phone from morning to night, only to raise it up to focus on television to watch another celebrity entertainment channel. Tell me, what else will dominate this lady s mindset aside how to live a fake celebrity life being promoted on television channels?Many African ladies now dislike cooking and home chores just because they had been totally brainwashed by movies showcasing men playing the role of women in a family, and due to excessive exposure to modern media that promotes gender-equality in a destructive way that s aimed at destroying the unique African family setting that made our previous African marriages everlasting and envious to the westerns. Now, with this attitude, how do you expect a African man to desire to marry when he knows he is only buying more headache and trouble than helper for himself?Excessive makeup turns most decent and serious-minded men off If you have observed, you will discover that most men dislike excessive makeup, and more don t even like it at all; reason they often times discourage their true loved ones to do away with it; because it speaks ill of a lady, even though so many men will applaud and complement you for looking like an Egyptian mummy. A slight makeup is okay; but if you are out for marriage, try always to look simple and natural; it will attract decent and serious-minded men, except you are still living your high school life and not thinking about marriage.Source : iMzansi!&nbsp;
