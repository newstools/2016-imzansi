Sometimes, the simplest invention can change millions of lives. That s the goal of The Shoe That Grows, a sandal invented by inventor Kenton Lee that can adjust its size, allowing children in impoverished nations to grow up without having to go barefoot. The shoes, which come in catch-all Small and Large sizes, can grow 5 sizes and last at least 5 years.According to The Shoe That Grows, There are over 300 million children who do not have shoes. And countless more with shoes that do not fit. Children without shoes are susceptible to injuries and parasites that infect humans through our feet. The problem with ordinary shoe donations is that they are soon outgrown, which is exactly the problem that these new shoes would fix. While you can buy yourself a pair, the site emphasizes packages that allow buyers to send shoes in bulk to the countries that need them the most.Kenton Lee was in Kenya for about six months when he noticed many children walking around barefoot and prone to parasites and diseases and wondered what he could do to help. Though he had no clue about designing shoes, he came up with the idea to create a durable shoe that can last up to 5 years. After struggling to get a company that would buy the idea, his efforts bore fruit when a shoe company by the name Proof Of Concept in Portland, Oregon decided to partner up with him and help design the shoe.Fast forward to today, Kenton Lee has managed to donate shoes to millions of poor kids from around the world!Source : Online!
